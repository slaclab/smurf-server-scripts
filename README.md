# Scripts to setup SMuRF server

## Description

This repository contains a set of useful scripts for setting up SMuRF servers, divided in two main categories:
- Scripts used to setup a SMuRF server from scratch,
- Scripts used to release docker system in an SMuRF server.

These scripts are used during SMuRF system deployments as described [here](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/SMuRF/SMuRF+Deployment).

## Documentation
